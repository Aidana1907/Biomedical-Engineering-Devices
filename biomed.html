  <h2>About Biomedical Engineering</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Biomedical engineering is an innovative field that combines engineering principles with medical and biological sciences to improve healthcare. It focuses on designing devices, equipment, and software that help diagnose, treat, and prevent diseases. 
<br>
Globally, the biomedical engineering market is growing rapidly. In 2025, it was valued at around $45 billion and is expected to reach $65 billion by 2030, with an annual growth rate of roughly 7%. This growth is driven by the increasing demand for advanced medical devices, aging populations, and the rise of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart conditions.
</br>
<br>
Biomedical engineers create a wide range of life-changing technologies. For example:

Medical imaging devices like MRI and CT scanners help doctors detect diseases early. Over 35 million MRI scans are performed worldwide each year.

Prosthetic limbs and implants are improving quality of life for millions; about 2 million Americans currently live with prosthetic devices.

Wearable health technology, such as smartwatches and glucose monitors, allows real-time tracking of vital signs. In 2024, over 200 million wearable devices were in use globally.

Beyond devices, biomedical engineers contribute to tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and robot-assisted surgeries, making treatments more precise and less invasive. Their work not only saves lives but also enhances comfort, mobility, and recovery times for patients.
</br>
<br>

In essence, biomedical engineering sits at the intersection of science, technology, and medicine, driving innovation that improves healthcare for millions worldwide.
